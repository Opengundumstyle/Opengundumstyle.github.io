							<h4>“It is far more common for people to allow ego to stand in the way of learning.” ― Ray Dalio, Principles</h4>
							<!-- <p> For a long period of time during college, I lost my motivation on learning anything new due to the fact that I didn't 
								want to look amateur by messing up on things that I haven't done, which end up preventing me from reaching my goal. Looking back, I
								realized how important it was to step back and do some meta-thinking of why things aren't going in a right direction.  
							</p>  -->
							<p> For a period of time in my life, I lost motivation on learning. Being lost and depressed, I developed a plan to make a significant 
								change - forcing myself to do difficult things or things I perceived as hard to accomplish. I started to read, to work out, to learn coding in a daily basis. Despite 
								being constantly challenged by the hardship of such endeavor, I slowly started to enjoy the process of exploring, struggling, adopting and understanding. It was 
								when I realized that learning a new thing is not as hard as it seems as long as I put my mind to it. And whatever that's viewed as difficult will eventaully gets easy with consistency of deliberate practice. 
							<p>

								<h4>What made me decide to switch: </h4>
								The shift of paradigm has made me decide to persuit software engineering. I wanted to take my coding skill to another level and enabling myself
								to contribute my passion toward coding for a bigger purpose. So, I decided to join App Academy. 
                                <br>
								<br>
								<h4>What I learnt during the bootcamp: </h4>
						        During the several months of grinding and building projects, I've gained the mindset of trying out things in different ways, 
								and does not afraid of messing up. As a software engineer, I've came to the conviction that nothing is going to work accordingly. 
								However it's crutial to embrace each failure and learn from it. Then seek for a better apporach. <br><br>
								Take the leap of faith for every single attempt, just like recursion :p
								<br><br>

								Being a software engineer helped straighten my thought process, it makes me a better decision maker. 
								It reignited my desire to learn, to not care if I look stupid during the quest of building something I am not familiar with. 
								It encouraged me to communicate, to listen, to exchange ideas. Most importantly, to think rationally toward "bugs" and look for 
								the practical solutions when obstacle presents itself.
