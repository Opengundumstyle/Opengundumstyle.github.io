                            <h4>“Rainy days should be spent at home with a cup of tea and a good book.” - Bill Watterson</h4>
							<p>To me, reading is just like tasting a delicious meal. It shouldn't be rushed...I enjoy the feeling of losing track of time when I am intrigued by the content. Even though I think reading experience is important, being able to digust and learn in a deeper level by reading is challenging. Lately I've decided to write summary and reflections on books I've read/planning to read on notion. Feel free to comment & join my quest to be a better reader! stay tuned. </p>
							<p>1. <a href="https://www.notion.so/Atomic-Habits-90e13df73b9b41a9a0be016f59aaf67e" target="_blank">Automic Habits</a><br>"We are what we repeatly do."Aristotle once said. I didn't understand the importance of this concept until I read this book.
							    It points me to a new direction where making changes & self improvement can be done in a smart and efficient way. 1.make it obvious 2.make it attractive 3.make it easy 4.make it satisfying. 
								By understanding and following the principles, I've gained more energy to improve on area in my life where I see lacking. Most importantly, It set a clear path for me to become more productive as a 
								software engineer by aligning my identity with what I do in a daily basis.

							<p><a href="https://www.notion.so/Thinking-fast-and-slow-f9f6280ecea4481c9a7600259649e803" target="_blank">2. Thinking fast & slow</a><br>
								It gives me a different perspective on viewing things. Before reading about this book,the way I look at problem is really one-sided without diving deep into the root cause. Now that I am aware of the two systems of my thinking. 
								one automatic, one calculated. I'll investigate my thinking process before jumping into conclusion when encountering new things in either life or work. 
							</p>
							<p><a href="https://www.notion.so/12-Rules-for-life-c5a6e4129f4c46a48be7f01dd57b0dff" target="_blank">3. 12 rules for life</a><br>
								Human beings don’t like rules and restraint. Yet, we need structure in our lives, which is impossible without rules. Rules bring order, facilitate cooperation and stable relationships, without which there’ll be chaos and uncertainty. Peterson believes that the way to live a free and full life is to embrace rules that help you to do good in life.

								The above three books provide a good groundwork and explaination of how to be the best version of oneself and live up to the potential in a microscopic way. In contrary ,the story of naval and his interpretation wrap up the purpose of the tools I acquire from the other books - 
								whether it's how to create good habits, think clearly and make better decision or set constraints to my behavior in order to acheive virtue in life. The end goal is to be happy, or rather be content and peace with myself. I think that's backbone of why I am doing what I do and keep improving myself. And thanks for reading, it reminds me of my purpose from time to time when I am lost.

							<span class="image right"><img src="images/gym.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Going to the gym has personally made me a better person by improving my physical and mental health. Before I started going to the gym, I struggled with low self-esteem and lack of confidence. I was also not very physically fit and often felt fatigued and lacked energy. However, since I started going to the gym regularly, I have noticed a significant improvement in my physical fitness and overall health. I have more energy, I feel stronger and more flexible, and I have even lost weight.</p>
							<p>But the biggest change I have noticed is in my mental health. The endorphins released during exercise have improved my mood and reduced my stress levels. Additionally, the social aspect of the gym has helped me make new friends and feel more connected to others. I now feel more confident and positive, and I am able to handle stress and challenges more effectively. Overall, going to the gym has made me a happier, healthier, and more confident person</p>
